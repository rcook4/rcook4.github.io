<p>This chart contains any trigram which was a top three usage for any given year.
<p>It is striking that across 200 years only six different trigrams crack the top three.
<p>This gives us an extremely high confidence that it was a balanced book selection across the years.
<p>Had 1800s been about gold, 1900s about earthquakes, 2000s about Hollywood then maybe all the books were from California.
<p>The y-axis is loosely based on the percentage of books the trigram appeared in that year.
<p>The table is case-sensitive so aggregating all case spellings results in values higher than 1.
<p>For example, imagine there is only ten books from 1800 and only one contains the word "history".
<p>If the book has only the sentence "History of the world is written about more than history of the universe.".
<p>Then the trigram "History of the" appears in ten percent of books and so does "history of the".
<p>Which would aggregate to show in the chart as -history of the- with usage of 0.2.
<p>This can safely be ignored as it is true of all trigrams and we are analyzing trends not seeking out a percentage.
