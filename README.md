## Messaging
You might expect for insurance compainies there to be a correlation between an increase in premiums and an increase in customer satisfaction but for these dataset and these methods of analysis, no such correlation was observed.

## Narrative Structure
This interactive slide show allows you to "drill-down" for additional details through tooltips which appear as you mouseover any chart.

## Visual Structure
Each scene includes the authors comments above a single line chart which uses a consistent legend and layout such that movement toward the upper right is considered improving.

## Scenes

What are the scenes of your narrative visualization? How are the scenes ordered, and why

## Annotations
What template was followed for the annotations, and why that template? How are the annotations used to support the messaging? Do the annotations change within a single scene, and if so, how and why

## Parameters
What are the parameters of the narrative visualization? What are the states of the narrative visualization? How are the parameters used to define the state and each scene?

## Triggers
What are the triggers that connect user actions to changes of state in the narrative visualization? What affordances are provided to the user to communicate to them what options are available to them in the narrative visualization?
