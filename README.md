## Messaging
You might expect that there will be a strong positive correlation between customer satisfaction and premiums written for auto insurance compainies. For this project that was not the case.

## Narrative Structure
This interactive slide show includes the ability to "drill-down" for additional details through tooltips which appear during mouseover of chart lines.

## Visual Structure
The OPENING scene explains what data is to be looked at, why it has value and in the order of the journey of the reader. Each remaining scene includes the writers comments highlighting important data items. These are always above the one line chart which uses a consistent color per company and visual style to include movement toward the upper right consistently being considered improvement. There is an italicized note to the reader informing them of existing tooltips. The NEXT and TOGGLE ANNOTATIONS buttons are consistently organized.

## Scenes
There is an OPENING scene detailing the hypothesis, data, test, results and references. They are ordered as a squence of hypothesis tests and therefore in a building the evidence of proof progression.

## Annotations
There exists annotations about the suspect data for the years 2015 and 2016. They follow from chart to chart since the same dataset is being used for each one.

## Parameters
There is a parameter for annotation visiblilty controlled by TOGGLE ANNOTATIONS buttons for setting both the inital and current state of displayed charts.

## Triggers
A top of screen navigation menu exists which will be familar to any reader, providing a trigger for transition to any scene. Additionally there exists a  bottom of screen NEXT button which triggers transition to the subquent scene.
