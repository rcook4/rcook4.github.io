## Messaging
You might expect that there will be a strong positive correlation between customer satisfaction and premiums written for auto insurance compainies.

## Narrative Structure
This interactive slide show includes the ability to "drill-down" for additional details through tooltips which appear during mouseover of any chart.

## Visual Structure
Each scene includes the authors comments above a single line chart which uses a consistent color per company and visual style to include ensuring that movement toward the upper right is always considered improving.

## Scenes
There is an OPENING scene detailing the hypothesis, data, test, results and references. The GROWTH scene establishes a baseline for trends of "premiums collected". The RANK scene is a test against trends of "customer satisfaction". The COMPLAINTS scene is a second test againsts trends of "customer satisfaction". The COMPLAINTS scene then wraps back around to the OPENING scene.

## Annotations
There exists annotations about the suspect data for the years 2015 and 2016. They follow from chart to chart since the same dataset is being used for each one.

## Parameters
There is a parameter for annotation visiblilty which controls both the inital and current state of any chart being displayed.

## Triggers
There exists a Next button which triggers transition to the subquent scene. Additionally a navigation menu exists above all scenes which allows for triggering transition to any selected scene.
