## Messaging
You might expect that for insurance compainies there would be a correlation between an increase in customer satisfaction and an increase in premiums collected, better service leading to more customers. For this specific dataset and these selected methods of analysis, there was no such correlation observed.

## Narrative Structure
This interactive slide show includes the ability to "drill-down" for additional details through tooltips which appear during mouseover of any chart.

## Visual Structure
Each scene includes the authors comments above a single line chart which uses a consistent color per company and visual style to include ensuring that movement toward the upper right is always considered improving.

## Scenes
There is an OPENING scene to describe the hypothesis and explain the data used. The GROWTH scene establishes a baseline for "increase in premiums collected". The RANK scene tests for "increase in customer satisfaction". The COMPLAINTS scene is also for testing "increase in customer satisfaction". The CLOSING scene describes the results of the hypothesis and lists the resources used.

## Annotations
There exists annocations about suspect data for the years 2015 and 2016 which follows from chart to chart since they all use the same dataset they all need to indicate the same suspecion.

## Parameters
There is a parameter for the annotations which sets both the inital and current state of each chart as to annotation visiblilty.

## Triggers
There exists a Next button which triggers transition to the subquent scene. Additionally a navigation menu exists for all scenes which allows for triggering transition to the selected scene.
