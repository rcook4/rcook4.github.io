## Messaging
You might expect for insurance compainies there to be a correlation between an increase in premiums and an increase in customer satisfaction but for these dataset and these methods of analysis, no such correlation was observed.

## Narrative Structure
This interactive slide show includes the ability to "drill-down" for additional details through tooltips which appear during mouseover of any chart.

## Visual Structure
Each scene includes the authors comments above a single line chart which uses a consistent legend and layout such that movement toward the upper right is considered improving.

## Scenes
There is an OPENING scene to describe the hypothesis and explain the data used. The GROWTH scene establishes a baseline for "increase in premiums". The RANK scene tests for "increase in customer satisfaction". The COMPLAINTS scene tests a second time for "increase in customer satisfaction". The CLOSING scene the describes the results of the hypothesis and lists the resources used for this project.

## Annotations
There was an annocation about suspect data for the years 2015 and 2016 which follows from chart to chart since they all use the same data they incur the same suspecion.

## Parameters
There is a parameter for the annotations which sets both the inital and current state of each chart as to whether annotations will be visible.

## Triggers
Navigation buttons exist across all scenes which trigger the transition to the selected scene.
