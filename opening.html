<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram" style="background-color: white; color: blue;">n-gram</a> is n-length series of terms from a text source.
<p><a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/info">Google Books Ngram Viewer</a> is a frontend query tool to their growing corpus of n-grams from millions of scanned books in multiple languages across several centuries.
<p>I wanted to determine if that corpus could be used to get a sense of what people were thinking about, by analyzing what people had written about.
<p>Unfortunately, the entire dataset is multiple petabytes in size and therefore too large to download or host online.
<p>Fortunately, Google does publicly host backend access to a static subset (English, 3-grams, 1520 to 2008) of the data as a BigQuery sample table <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sample-tables">trigrams</a>.
<p>I decided to use that data knowing I would be giving up some flexibility and therefore accuracy, for the sake of ease and usability.
<p>The first step was to look for anomalies in the top trigrams.
<p>The second step was to look for anomalies in the high frequency subjects.
<p>The final step was to look for anomalies in a specific group of words, in this case technologies.
